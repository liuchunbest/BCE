This project is to extract frequent bigram collocations from public textual product descriptions. 

Some notes about the programs are as follows:

    1.The test data are in the folder of data. 

    2.Most of programs are in the file of feature_extraction_by_collocation. The programs in the file of product only define the class of prodct.  

    3.When you run the programs, the path in the file of parameters should be first modified. The path is the complete file path of the project. The programs are writed with python. Some related packages are required. 

    4.When running the program, you can run the file of feature_extraction_by_collocation. You should first go to the buttom of this file and modify the path of the file which saves the data to be processed. And the results are writted in the file of log. 

    5.These programs have been writted by different persons and for a long time. So there are inconsistencies for the style of naming varables and functions. If you have interests in such programs and there are some problems, please write the email to liuchun@henu.edu.cn.

    6.We would be grateful if you find some defects about the programs and send them to us.
